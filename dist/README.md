# Description
A module to make imports for the GURPS system easier. Currently it allows for quick reimports of XML files exported from GCS (GCA should also work but isn't tested). <br>
It also restricts the files selection for the imports to XML in the file choosing dialog. <br>
In the future I plan to try make it parse GCS files directly<br><br>
